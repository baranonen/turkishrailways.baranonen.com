	<p>Welcome to the Turkish Railways Guide.</p>
	<h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
	<p>There are lots of info about railways in countries like the UK, Germany and the USA but technical information about Turkish railways is very limited. In fact, let alone English documents, there are not a lot of documents in Turkish either.</p>
	<p>I'm aiming to help fix this problem and share my knowledge with other people here.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me via <a href="mailto:baran@baranonen.com">mail</a>.</p>
	<h2>What kind of info are we talking about?</h2>
	<p>I'm interested in software development and electronics. Because of this, I mostly like modern trains with modern signalization systems. I'm also interested in interlocking systems as well.</p>
