	<p>As of 2019, only 45% of the railways in Turkey are electrified and signalled. In signalled parts, a system called CTC is being used.</p>
	<p>CTC consists of mainly 3 types of signals.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Yüksek Sinyal <br> <small>Tall Signals</small></li>
		<li>Cüce Sinyal <br> <small>Small Signals</small></li>
		<li>Tekrarlama Sinyali <br> <small>Repeater Signals</small></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Tall Signals</h2>
	<figure>

		<figcaption>Tall Signal Types</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Tall signals are the most common type of these three. They can be mounted both on the right/left side of the track or on the top of it, using steel beams.</p>
	<h2>Small Signals</h2>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/SmallSignals.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Small Signal Types</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Small signals are only found in depots / sidings and are mounted on short steel pipes.</p>
	<h2>Repeater Signal</h2>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/RepeaterSignal.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Repeater Signal</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>In case the main signal cannot be seen from a set distance, a repeater signal can be placed up to 400 m before the main signal.</p>
	<p>These type of signals have the letter "T", telling that the signal is a "Tekrarlama Sinyali"</p>

	<h2>Signal Aspects</h2>
	<p>Before going deeper, let's see some basic examples:</p>

		<figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>In tall signals that do not flash, yellow over a yellow as in Figure 1 means that one block is free and the route is set for the diverging track.</p>

		<figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>In tall signals that do not flash, green as in Figure 2 means that at least 2 blocks are free.</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/Example3.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Since small signals are found in sidings, the route is always set to the diverging track. Maximum speed over the switches is 30 km/h. </p>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/Example4.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>A flashing light as in Figure 4 means continue with "restricted speed" (sınırlı seyir) which is 25 km/h.</p>

	<figure>

	<p>At least two blocks are free. Continue with the allowed maximum speed.</p>
	<figure>

		<figcaption>Yellow in a tall signal</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Only one block is free. Expect stop at the next signal.</p>
	<p>In case where the next block is shorter than the braking distance, the previous signal is also yellow.</p>

	<p>In shunting operations controlled by the OCC, trains in non signalled areas cannot enter signalled areas in the same direction.</p>
	<p>Proceed with a maximum speed of 25 km/h.</p>
	<h2>Special Cases</h2>
	<p>Tracks that are in the Marmaray line (Istanbul) are also equipped with the CBTC signalization system. This system allows for more than one trains to be in the same block, resulting in more frequent operations.</p>
	<p>Signals in this line have one more light on top which is blue.</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/BlueOverRed.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Blue over red in three different signal types</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>This aspect means that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The next block is occupied by a train that has CBTC equipment.</li>
		<li>The distance between the signal and the train is longer than the minimum safe distance for CBTC operation.</li>
		<li>If the train that has stopped short of this system has CBTC equipment as well, it can move again.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here's a sample of what happens in this situation: (the video is a bit loud)</p>
	<video src="assets/CBTCMarmaray.mov" controls></video>
	<p>The signal turns red again when the train passes it. This means that the next train is not yet enough far away for safe CBTC operaton.</p>
	<hr>
	<figure>
		<img src="assets/BlankSignals.svg" alt="">
		<figcaption>Blank signals</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Signals that show any other aspect / are broken / don't have any visible lights order a complete stop.</p>
	<p>In this case, the OCC should be called and orders from there should be followed.</p>
